# Y Combinator Application Drafts

## Question
**Walk us through your thinking around balancing your startup, school, and any other obligations.**

### Draft Option 1: The "All-In" Builder (Recommended)
"School is currently running on a background thread. SentinelMD is my main process.

I have optimized my courseload for maximum flexibility (asynchronous lectures, project-based classes) to ensure I have 60+ hours/week for shipping code. My grades are sufficient to stay enrolled, but I am not optimizing for a 4.0; I am optimizing for product-market fit.

If accepted into YC, I will take a leave of absence immediately. The window for AI-native medical scribes is opening now, and I refuse to let homework assignments prevent me from capturing this market."


### Draft Option 2: The "Balanced but Focused" Approach
"I treat my startup as my full-time job and school as my moonlight activity. I schedule all my classes safely around my peak coding hours and block out dedicated deep-work sessions for SentinelMD every day.

I've already completed most of my core requirements, so my current workload is manageable. However, I am ready to pause my degree the moment this requires my undivided attention—which I believe is now."

## Section: Accomplishments

### Question
**Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.**

> **[REQUIRED INPUT]**
> *Constraint: This question specifically asks for a **non-computer** system hack. Your resume is very technical, so I cannot answer this for you. Think of a time you:*
> * *Talked your way out of a fine?*
> * *Found a loophole in a university policy?*
> * *Optimized a physical process (like a queue or application process)?*
> * *Bartered for something significantly more valuable?*

### Question
**Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.**

**Option 1 (Traction/Impact Focus - Recommended):**
"I built and shipped the 'Workout Tools' mobile app for EXRX.NET in just 12 weeks; it acquired over 15,000 users in its first month and maintained a 4.6-star rating."

**Option 2 (Deep Tech/Systems Focus):**
"I architected a distributed 'Edge AI Persona Simulator' on Cloudflare Workers that utilized Durable Objects to maintain consistent state for 10,000+ simulated concurrent users with sub-50ms latency."

---

### Question
**Tell us about things you've built before. For example apps you've built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.**

**Workout Tools (Mobile App)**
*   Shipped to iOS/Android in 12 weeks.
*   **Metric:** 15,000+ users in Month 1. Reduced onboarding time by 85% (8m → 90s).
*   **Tech:** Laravel API, Flutter UI.

**Edge AI Persona Simulator**
*   **Tech:** TypeScript, Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects.
*   **Detail:** A distributed system validating Zero Trust gateways by simulating 10K+ concurrent user personas (CDN cache, WAF) with <50ms p99 latency.

**Avera - Neighborhood Safety Platform**
*   **Tech:** Django REST, Next.js, PostGIS, Docker.
*   **Detail:** A full-stack geospatial platform providing explainable safety snapshots for US neighborhoods using official crime data.

**Tower Defense AI Simulation**
*   **Tech:** PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning (PPO).
*   **Detail:** Trained AI agents that achieved a 78% win rate (outperforming baseline A* search by 25%) in a custom simulation environment.

---

### Question
**List any competitions/awards you have won, or papers you've published.**

*   **pending:** Research Review (University of New Haven) - *[Need detail: What is the topic?]*
*   *[Missing from resume: Any hackathons won? Undergraduate awards? Scholarships?]*

## Section: Founder Video

### Question
**The video should be 1 minute long and should contain nothing except the founders talking. Do not recite a written script: Use bullet points.**

**Location:** Sit in front of a whiteboard or your coding setup. Good lighting.

**Script (Bullet Points - "Founder's Passion" Version):**

*   **The Specific Insight:** "Hi YC. I'm Ray. I realized something terrifying: Doctors want to use AI, but they are terrified of the Cloud. Privacy laws are blocking the biggest tech shift in medicine."
*   **The Hard Problem:** "To fix this, you can't just wrap ChatGPT. You have to rebuild the entire clinical stack to run **locally** on 6-year-old hospital laptops."
*   **The Competence:** "That's why I built SentinelMD. I used my background in distributed systems (scaling to 50M users) to optimize local LLMs for the edge."
*   **The Demo (Visual Proof):** "Watch this. I unplug the internet. I speak complex medical jargon. It transcribes, analyzes safety risks, and translates instructions instantly—**zero latency, zero data leak**."
*   **The Vision:** "This isn't just a scribe. It's an offline safety net for every doctor in the world. We are unblocking AI for healthcare."
